# Dependency_check_report
Dependency Check Report

This project includes a Dependency-Check scan to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. The scan was performed using OWASP Dependency-Check, an open-source tool that analyzes dependencies against the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to detect security risks.
Supply Chain Security Monitoring

This scan is part of a broader Supply Chain Security Monitoring effort, which aims to detect and mitigate risks in third-party software components. Along with OWASP Dependency-Check, additional tools like SonarQube, GitHub Dependabot, and SAST (Static Application Security Testing) can be used to enhance security monitoring.
Scan Summary:

    Project: Flask App
    Scan Tool: OWASP Dependency-Check (Version 8.4.0)
    Report Generated On: Wed, 12 Feb 2025
    Dependencies Scanned: 0
    Vulnerabilities Found: 0
    Vulnerabilities Suppressed: 0

Since Dependency-Check is primarily designed for compiled software packages (such as Java and JavaScript), it may have limited accuracy when scanning Python projects. However, this report provides a basic security assessment of the dependencies used in this Flask application.

The generated dependency-check-report.html file uploaded contains the scan results, confirming that no known vulnerabilities were detected. For a more comprehensive security review, additional tools like Bandit and Safety should be used alongside this report.
